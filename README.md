🏠 House Price Predictor — End-to-End ML Project

🚧 Status: In Progress

This project aims to build a complete machine learning pipeline to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset. The goal is to demonstrate practical skills in data analysis, model training, and deployment using Streamlit.

🎯 Project Goals

Perform detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Apply data preprocessing and feature engineering

Train and compare multiple regression models

Build an interactive Streamlit prediction app

Deploy the model for real-world usage

🧠 Tech Stack (Planned)

Python

Pandas, NumPy

scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Streamlit
